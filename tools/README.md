## tools/
This contains any scripts, CMake modules, or other components that are needed to build the project or which facilitate project building and development. If you create a script to stylize the code according to your project's specifications or if you create a script to validate that project guidelines are being followed, the "bin" subfolder of "tools" would be the appropriate location to place those scripts. If you need to add modules to CMake (e.g. to implement "FIND_PACKAGE" for an additional package), you should place those scripts in "tools/share/cmake". You can already find examples of such modules for locating Log4Cxx and UnitTest++.
